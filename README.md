### Project Title : DishClose 

### Project Description:
Have you ever wondered what special ingredient makes your 
favorite dish tick? If you are a foodie who loves to cook and explore his/her culinary skills then 
DishClose is just for you. Using this system, you can find the key ingredients associated with a 
dish and also get suggestions for making a different dish using similar ingredients. With the help 
of machine learning, this system will be trained with a variety of pictures of dishes across the 
world and will constantly get better at suggestions when users upload their own recipes.
