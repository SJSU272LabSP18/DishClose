Team Name: Project Team 9 – Codesquad  

Project Title1: Railway track fault detection using unmanned aerial vehicle

Project Description: Every year in India, there are hundreds of train accidents, a number of which lead to loss of human life. Investigations have shown that almost all of them occur due to negligence or inability to carry out regular maintenance checks on these tracks. This paucity of human capital can be overcome by the usage of unmanned aerial vehicles (drone), which will scan these tracks and capture points of probable anomalies, thus drastically reducing the inspection fields for service engineers. An anomaly dashboard application will generate timely reports revealing authentic faults as well as the status of their repairs. 

Proposed methodology/ resources: Data Science Experience Service on IBM Cloud, Machine Learning for image analysis, Dashboard implementation with NodeJS and ReactJS, Docker for deployment. 

Project Title2: #DishClose
Project Description: Have you ever wondered what special ingredient makes your favorite dish tick? If you are a foodie who loves to cook and explore his/her culinary skills then DishClose is just for you. Using this system, you can find the key ingredients associated with a dish and also get suggestions for making a different dish using similar ingredients. With the help of machine learning, this system will be trained with a variety of pictures of dishes across the world and will constantly get better at suggestions when users upload their own recipes. 

Proposed methodology/ resources: Data Science Experience Service on IBM Cloud, Scikit-image package on python for image analysis. 


Project Title3: Securing Assets on Blockchain

Project Description: There are many assets in the world such as real estate, stacks, gold and so on. We cannot physically transfer or subdivide many of these assets easily, hence we use paper based trading agreement that represents some or all of the asset. But this process is tiresome, has logistical issues and is difficult to track. One of the solutions for this is the use of blockchain. The idea here is the conversion process of assets rights into a digital token on blockchain. 

Proposed methodology/ resources: IBM Bluemix’s open source hyperledger platform composer for creation of Blockchain, ReactJS application for User Interface with the REST API which will be communicating with blockchain backend, Docker for Blockchain Network Deployment.
