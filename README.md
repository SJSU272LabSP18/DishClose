### Comment: 
#1 is a good problem to solve, but  needs a lot of data and labeled data for drone to find  anomalies. Make sure you  can find data to train neural network model. Tensorflow does a good job  on image detection.
I approve this ... pls remove all your other ideas from README


Project Title1: Railway track fault detection using unmanned aerial vehicle

Project Description: Every year in India, there are hundreds of train accidents, a number of which lead to loss of human life. Investigations have shown that almost all of them occur due to negligence or inability to carry out regular maintenance checks on these tracks. This paucity of human capital can be overcome by the usage of unmanned aerial vehicles (drone), which will scan these tracks and capture points of probable anomalies, thus drastically reducing the inspection fields for service engineers. An anomaly dashboard application will generate timely reports revealing authentic faults as well as the status of their repairs. 

Proposed methodology/ resources: Data Science Experience Service on IBM Cloud, Machine Learning for image analysis, Dashboard implementation with NodeJS and ReactJS, Docker for deployment.
